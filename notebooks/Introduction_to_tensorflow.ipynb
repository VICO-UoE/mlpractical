    "In the first semester we used the NumPy-based `mlp` Python package to illustrate the concepts involved in automatically propagating gradients through multiple-layer neural network models. We also looked at how to use these calculated derivatives to do gradient-descent based training of models in supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key theme in the first semester's work was the idea of defining models in a modular fashion. There we considered  models composed of a sequence of *layer* modules, the output of each of which fed into the input of the next in the sequence and each applying a transformation to map inputs to outputs. By defining a standard interface to layer objects with each defining a `fprop` method to *forward propagate* inputs to outputs, and a `bprop` method to *back propagate* gradients with respect to the output of the layer to gradients with respect to the input of the layer, the layer modules could be composed together arbitarily and activations and gradients forward and back propagated through the whole stack respectively.\n",

    "By construction a layer was defined as an object with a single array input and single array output. This is a natural fit for the architectures of standard feedforward networks which can be thought of a single pipeline of transformations from user provided input data to predicted outputs as illustrated in the figure above. \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Towards the end of last semester however we encountered several models which do not fit so well in to this pipeline-like structure. For instance (unrolled) recurrent neural networks tend to have inputs feeding in to and outputs feeding out from multiple points along a deep feedforward model corresponding to the updates of the hidden recurrent state, as illustrated in the left panel in the figure above. It is not trivial to see how to map this structure to our layer based pipeline. Similarly models with skip connections between layers as illustrated in the right panel of the above figure also do not fit particularly well in to a pipeline structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally we would like to be able to compose modular components in more general structures than the pipeline structure we have being using so far. In particular it turns out to be useful to be able to deal with models which have structures defined by arbitrary [*directed acyclic graphs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAGs), that is graphs connected by directed edges and without any directed cycles. Both the recurrent network and skip-connections examples can be naturally expressed as DAGs as well many other model structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with these more general graphical structures, rather than considering a graph made up of layer modules, it often more useful to consider lower level mathematical operations or *ops* that make up the computation as the fundamental building block. A DAG composed of ops is often termed a *computation graph*. THis terminolgy was covered briefly in [lecture 6](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/2017-18/mlp06-enc.pdf), and also in the [MLPR course](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlpr/2016/notes/w5a_backprop.html). The backpropagation rules we used to propagate gradients through a stack of layer modules can be naturally generalised to apply to computation graphs, with this method of applying the chain rule to automatically propagate gradients backwards through a general computation graph also sometimes termed [*reverse-mode automatic differentiation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Reverse_accumulation).\n",

    "The figure above shows a very simple computation graph corresponding to the mathematical expression  $\\boldsymbol{y} = \\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{x} + \\boldsymbol{b}$, i.e. the affine transformation we encountered last semester. Here the nodes of the graph are operations and the edges the vector or matrix values passed between operations. The opposite convention with nodes as values and edges as operations is also sometimes used. Note that just like there was ambiguity about what to define as a layer (as discussed previously at beginning of the [third lab notebook](03_Multiple_layer_models.ipynb), there are a range of choices for the level of abstraction to use in the op nodes in a computational graph. For instance, we could also have chosen to express the above computational graph with a single `AffineTransform` op node with three inputs (one matrix, two vector) and one vector output. Equally we might choose to express the `MatMul` op in terms of the underlying individual scalar addition and multiplication operations. What to consider an operation is therefore somewhat a matter of choice and what is convenient in a particular setting.\n",

    "To allow us to work with models defined by more general computation graphs and to avoid the need to write `fprop` and `bprop` methods for each new model component we want to try out, this semester we will be using the open-source computation graph framework [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), originally developed by the Google Brain team:\n",
    "\n",
    "> TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs \n",
    "in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow allows complex computation graphs (also known as data flow graphs in TensorFlow parlance) to be defined via a Python interface, with efficient C++ implementations for running the corresponding operations on different devices. TensorFlow also includes tools for automatic gradient computation and a large and growing suite of pre-define operations useful for gradient-based training of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will introduce some of the basic elements of constructing, training and evaluating models with TensorFlow. This will use similar material to some of the [official TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) but with an additional emphasis of making links to the material covered in this course last semester. For those who have not used a computational graph framework such as TensorFlow or Theano before you may find the [basic usage tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/basic_usage) useful to go through.\n",

These are nodes in the computation graph to which we will later *feed* in external data, such as batches of training set inputs and targets. This abstraction allows us to reuse the same computation graph for different data inputs - we can think of placeholders as acting equivalently to the arguments of a function. It is actually possible to feed data into any node in a TensorFlow graph however the advantage of using a placeholder is that is *must* always have a value fed into it (an exception will be raised if a value isn't provided) and no arbitrary alternative values needs to be entered.\n",

The most basic `Optimizer` instance is the `GradientDescentOptimizer` which simply adds operations corresponding to basic (stochastic) gradient descent to the graph (i.e. no momentum, adaptive learning rates etc.). The `__init__` constructor method for this class takes one argument `learning_rate` corresponding to the gradient descent learning rate / step size encountered previously.\n",

The `minimize` method returns an operation corresponding to applying the gradient updates to the variables - we need to store a reference to this to allow us to run these operations later.

This is because TensorFlow always registers a default graph at start up and all operations are added to this graph by default. The default graph can be accessed using `tf.get_default_graph()`. For example running the code in the cell below will assign a reference to the default graph to `default_graph` and print the total number of operations in the current graph definition."

    "To add operations to a constructed graph object, we use the `graph.as_default()` [context manager](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/context_managers.html). Context managers are used with the `with` statement in Python - `with context_manager:` opens a block in Python in which a special `__enter__` method of the `context_manager` object is called before the code in the block is run and a further special `__exit__` method is run after the block code has finished execution. This can be used to for example manage allocation of resources (e.g. file handles) but also to locally change some 'context' in the code - in the example here, `graph.as_default()` is a context manager which changes the default graph within the following block to be `graph` before returning to the previous default graph once the block code is finished running. Context managers are used extensively in TensorFlow so it is worth being familiar with how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common context manager usage in TensorFlow is to define *name scopes*. As we encountered earlier, individual operations in a TensorFlow graph can be assigned names. As we will see later this is useful for making graphs interpretable when we use the tools provided in TensorFlow for visualising them. As computation graphs can become very big (even the quite simple graph we created in the first exercise has around 100 operations in it) even with interpretable names attached to the graph operations it can still be difficult to understand and debug what is happening in a graph. Therefore rather than simply allowing a single-level naming scheme to be applied to the individual operations in the graph, TensorFlow supports hierachical naming of sub-graphs. This allows sets of related operations to be grouped together under a common name, and thus allows both higher and lower level structure in a graph to be easily identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hierarchical naming is performed by using the name scope context manager `tf.name_scope('name')`. Starting a block `with tf.name_scope('name'):`, will cause all the of the operations added to a graph within that block to be grouped under the name specified in the `tf.name_scope` call. Name scope blocks can be nested to allow finer-grained sub-groupings of operations. Name scopes can be used to group operations at various levels e.g. operations corresponding to inference/prediction versus training, grouping operations which correspond to the classical definition of a neural network layer etc.\n",

    "A common problem when doing gradient based training of complex models is how to monitor progress during training. In the `mlp` framework we used last semester we included some basic logging functionality for recording training statistics such as training and validation set error and classificaton accuracy at the end of each epoch. By printing the log output this allowed basic monitoring of how training was proceeding. However due to the noisiness of the the training procedures the raw values printed were often difficult to interpret. After a training run we often plotted training curves to allow better visualisation of how the run went but this could only be done after a run was completed and required a lot of boilerplate code to be written (or copied and pasted...).\n",

    "TensorFlow [*summary* operations](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/summary/) are designed to help deal with this issue. Summary operations can be added to the graph to allow summary statistics to be computed and serialized to event files. These event files can then be loaded in TensorBoard *during training* to allow continuous graphing of for example the training and validation set error during training. As well as summary operations for monitoring [scalar](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/summary/generation_of_summaries_#scalar) values such as errors or accuracies, TensorFlow also includes summary operations for monitoring [histograms](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/summary/generation_of_summaries_#histogram) of tensor quanties (e.g. the distribution of a set of weight parameters), displaying [images](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/summary/generation_of_summaries_#image) (for example for checking if random augmentations being applied to image inputs are producing reasonable outputs) and even playing back [audio](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/summary/generation_of_summaries_#audio).\n",

While we can keep references to all of the summary ops we add to a graph and make sure to run them all individually in the session during training, as with variable initialisation, TensorFlow provides a convenience method to avoid having to write a lot of boilerplate code like this. The `tf.summary.merge_all()` function returns an merged op corresponding to all of the summary ops that have been added to the current default graph. We can then just run this one merged op in our session to generate all the summaries we have added."

In the code below the log directory is specified as a local directory `tf-log` plus a timestamp based sub-directory within this to keep event files corresponding to different runs separated.

    "\n",
    "As well as the core officially supported codebase, TensorFlow is distributed with a series of contributed modules under [`tensorflow.contrib`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib). These tend to provide higher level interfaces for constructing and running common forms of computational graphs which can allow models to be constructed with much more concise code. The interfaces of the `contrib` modules tend to be less stable than the core TensorFlow Python interface and they are also more restricted in the sorts of models that can be created. Therefore it is worthwhile to also be familiar with constructing models with the operations available in the core TensorFlow codebase; you can also often mix and match use of 'native' TensorFlow and functions from `contrib` modules.\n",

    "As an optional extension exercise, construct a deep EMNIST classifier model, either using TensorFlow operations directly as above or using one (or more) of the higher level interfaces defined in `contrib` modules such as [`tensorflow.contrib.learn`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/tflearn/), [`tensorflow.contrib.layers`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers) or [`tensorflow.contrib.slim`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim). You should choose an appropriate model architecture (number and width of layers) and choice of activation function based on your experience fitting models from last semester.\n",
