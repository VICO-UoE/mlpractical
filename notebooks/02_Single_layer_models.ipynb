    "It is generally a good practice (for machine learning applications **not** for cryptography!) to seed a pseudo-random number generator once at the beginning of each experiment. This makes it easier to reproduce results as the same random draws will produced each time the experiment is run (e.g. the same random initialisations used for parameters). Therefore generally when we need to generate random values during this course, we will create a seeded random number generator object as we do in the cell below."

    "## Exercise 3: computing the error function and its gradient\n",

    "Here we will consider the task of regression as covered in the first lecture slides. The aim in a regression problem is given inputs $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{x}^{(n)}\\right\\rbrace_{n=1}^N$ to produce outputs $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{y}^{(n)}\\right\\rbrace_{n=1}^N$ that are as 'close' as possible to a set of target outputs $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{t}^{(n)}\\right\\rbrace_{n=1}^N$. The measure of 'closeness' or distance between target and predicted outputs is a design choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very common choice is the squared Euclidean distance between the predicted and target outputs. This can be computed as the sum of the squared differences between each element in the target and predicted outputs. A common convention is to multiply this value by $\\frac{1}{2}$ as this gives a slightly nicer expression for the error gradient. The error for the $n^{\\textrm{th}}$ training example is then\n",

    "*Note here we are using a slightly different convention from the lectures. There the overall error was considered to be the sum of the individual error terms rather than the mean. To differentiate between the two we will use $\\bar{E}$ to represent the average error here as opposed to sum of errors $E$ as used in the slides with $\\bar{E} = \\frac{E}{N}$. Normalising by the number of training examples is helpful to do in practice as this means we can more easily compare errors across data sets / batches of different sizes, and more importantly it means the size of our gradient updates will be independent of the number of training examples summed over.*\n",
    "\n",

We will therefore generally use iterative, gradient descent based training methods to find parameters which (locally) minimise the error function. A basic requirement of being able to do gradient-descent based training is (unsuprisingly) the ability to evaluate gradients of the error function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next exercise we will consider how to calculate gradients of the error function with respect to the model parameters $\\mathbf{W}$ and $\\boldsymbol{b}$, but as a first step here we will consider the gradient of the error function with respect to the model outputs $\\left\\lbrace \\boldsymbol{y}^{(n)}\\right\\rbrace_{n=1}^N$.
