    "### Note on storing matrices in computer memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to store the following matrix in memory: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n",
    "7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right]$ \n",
    "\n",
    "If you allocate the memory at once for the whole matrix, then the above matrix would be organised as a vector in one of two possible forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Row-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "* Column-wise layout where the order would look like: $\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\n",
    "1 & 4 & 7 & 2 & 5 & 8 & 3 & 6 & 9 \\end{array} \\right ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `numpy` can easily handle both formats (possibly with some computational overhead), in our code we will stick with the more modern (and default) `C`-like approach and use the row-wise format (in contrast to Fortran that used a column-wise approach). \n",
    "\n",
    "This means, that in this tutorial:\n",
    "* vectors are kept row-wise $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D) $ (rather than $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_1, \\ldots, x_D)^T$)\n",
    "* similarly, in case of matrices we will stick to: $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\n",
    "x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{21} & x_{22} & \\ldots & x_{2D} \\\\\n",
    "x_{31} & x_{32} & \\ldots & x_{3D} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right]$ and each row (i.e. $\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc} x_{11} & x_{12} & \\ldots & x_{1D} \\end{array} \\right]$) represents a single data-point (like one MNIST image or one window of observations)\n",

    "## Linear and Affine Transforms\n",

Modify `MetOfficeDataProvider` (for example, inherit from MetOfficeDataProvider to create a new class MetOfficeDataProviderBin) and modify `next()` function so it returns as `targets` either 0 (not-rainy - if the the amount of rain [before mean/variance normalisation] is equal to 0) or 1 (rainy -- otherwise).\n",
