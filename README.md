# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

This assignment-based course is focused on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students who do this course will have experience in the design, implementation, training, and evaluation of machine learning systems.

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the course that students will implement parts of and extend during the course labs and assignments,
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing explanatory material and coding exercises to be completed during the course labs.

## Coursework 1
This branch contains the python code and latex files of the first coursework. The code follows the same structure as the labs, in particular the mlp package, and a specific notebook is provided to help you run experiments.
 * Detailed instructions are given in MLP2024_25_CW1_Spec.pdf (see Learn, Assessment, CW1).
 * The [report directory](https://github.com/VICO-UoE/mlpractical/tree/mlp2024-25/coursework1/report) contains the latex files that you will use to create your report.
